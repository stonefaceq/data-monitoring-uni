# How to Run the System

### 1. Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stonefaceq/data-monitoring-uni.git
cd data-monitoring-uni
```

### 2. Start All Services

Start all services by running:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

* `--build` forces a rebuild of the `auth-service` and `data-generator` images with the latest code.
* `-d` runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

## Accessing the Services

Once the system is running, you can access the following web interfaces:

* **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
* **Auth**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)


## Stopping the System

To stop and remove all containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
